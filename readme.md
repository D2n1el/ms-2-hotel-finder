## Technologies Used

During development of website I used

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
- [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#:~:text=The%20HyperText%20Markup%20Language%2C%20or,displayed%20in%20a%20web%20browser.&text=HTML%20provides%20a%20means%20to,links%2C%20quotes%20and%20other%20items.)
- [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)
- [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
- [Google Maps Api](https://developers.google.com/maps?hl=en)



## Testing
During Development so far i tested each block of the website separately. Manual testing was the main part of this project, As I was going for a user focus I wanted to ensure all parts of the project were user-centric and therefore manually adding in the code and ensuring the code was working before moving onto the next stage of development. I tested responsiveness on Am I Responsive In addition I checked the code using w3c css and markup validator.

## Deployment
I have deployed this project on Netlify to https://dreamy-mccarthy-e71879.netlify.app/ domain

This service is very convenient, since you just need to select your repository in github and the deployment process will automatically go through
